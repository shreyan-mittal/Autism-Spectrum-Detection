Autism Spectrum Detection using Deep CNN

This is a research work and we detected Autism in various age groups with enhaced accuracy.
Deep CNNs demonstrate potential in accurately detecting autism spectrum disorder through the analysis of neuroimaging data. 
This model, comprising convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, is trained on labeled datasets distinguishing ASD from non-ASD cases.
